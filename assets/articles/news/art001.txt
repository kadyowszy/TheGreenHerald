Cavite State University's (CvSU) 2025 Culture and the Arts Festival is underway, bringing together students from its campuses and colleges for celebration and competition since the event's May 28th commencement. A highlight, the search for the CAF King and Queen, was held on Thursday afternoon, May 29th, at the International Convention Center.

The festival schedule includes events where students showcase abilities in charcoal rendering, pencil drawing, painting, pop solo, and instrumental solo. The gathering of university system campuses fosters a spirit of creativity and camaraderie.

The university community witnessed the selection of the new CAF King and Queen last Thursday. The pageant, an event of grace, wit, and advocacy, saw the chosen students designated as university ambassadors. The Culture and the Arts Festival continues as a platform for student artistic expression and competition.
